The Camelot Parent Teacher Association (PTA) is a non-profit volunteer organization that supports the Camelot Elementary School. The PTA's mission is to make every child's potential a reality by engaging and empowering families and communities to advocate for all children.

Just a few ways the Camelot PTA supports our school includes: funding field trips for all grade levels, planning after school educational programs, engaging the school community through social events, in-school assemblies, and classroom teaching tools.

The Camelot PTA is focused on supporting our school and children by being:

  * directly involved in programs that benefit our children.  
  * offering suggestions when the staff needs a parental point of view.
  * helping plan ongoing programs and offer support to initiatives that bring new ideas to the school.
  * offering the teachers and administrators support whenever we can!


We are focused on supporting the national PTA Values of: 

  * **Collaboration**: We will work in partnership with a wide array of individuals and organizations to broaden and enhance our ability to serve and advocate for all children and families.

  * **Commitment**: We are dedicated to children's educational success, health, and well-being through strong family and community engagement, while remaining accountable to the principles upon which our association was founded.

  * **Diversity**: We acknowledge the potential of everyone without regard, including but not limited to: age, culture, economic status, educational background, ethnicity, gender, geographic location, legal status, marital status, mental ability, national origin, organizational position, parental status, physical ability, political philosophy, race, religion, sexual orientation, and work experience.

  * **Respect**: We value the individual contributions of members, employees, volunteers, and partners as we work collaboratively to achieve our association's goals.

  * **Accountability**: All members, volunteers, and partners have a shared responsibility to align their efforts toward the achievement of our association's strategic initiatives.

It is through ongoing involvement where the more of us that are involved the more we can get done! Please consider [joining the PTA](/sign-up) and becoming involved in continuing to make Camelot great!
